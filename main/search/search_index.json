If prerotation is true the did will be able to be rotated by the controller.</p> <p>Response - Unless there's a problem connecting with the witness or server you should get a success response with the did document. <pre><code>{\n  \"@context\": [\n    \"https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1\",\n    \"https://w3id.org/security/multikey/v1\"\n  ],\n  \"id\": \"did:webvh:QmQ3m3nAL8Ds7bpnHHbiPZsSs9x6RmMJXomNYHgMrmghnU:id.test-suite.app:finance:accounting\",\n  \"authentication\": [\n    \"did:webvh:QmQ3m3nAL8Ds7bpnHHbiPZsSs9x6RmMJXomNYHgMrmghnU:id.test-suite.app:finance:accounting#key-01\"\n  ],\n  \"assertionMethod\": [\n    \"did:webvh:QmQ3m3nAL8Ds7bpnHHbiPZsSs9x6RmMJXomNYHgMrmghnU:id.test-suite.app:finance:accounting#key-01\"\n  ],\n  \"verificationMethod\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"did:webvh:QmQ3m3nAL8Ds7bpnHHbiPZsSs9x6RmMJXomNYHgMrmghnU:id.test-suite.app:finance:accounting#key-01\",\n      \"type\": \"Multikey\",\n      \"controller\": \"did:webvh:QmQ3m3nAL8Ds7bpnHHbiPZsSs9x6RmMJXomNYHgMrmghnU:id.test-suite.app:finance:accounting\",\n      \"publicKeyMultibase\": \"z6Mknsk9KAs7UofpuZsuSzBkmxZjo63WRwAAj1mnifkVLhqh\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"webvh/#manual-attest","title":"Manual attest","text":"<p>Controller - Create did:webvh same as above</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"status\": \"pending\",\n  \"message\": \"The witness is pending.\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Witness get pending - <code>GET /did/webvh/pending</code> <pre><code>{\n  \"results\": [\n    {\n      \"@context\": [\n        \"https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1\",\n        \"https://w3id.org/security/multikey/v1\"\n      ],\n      \"id\": \"did:web:id.test-suite.app:finance:cfbac7a9-0e0c-4bd8-af71-05e33f9e47a5\",\n      \"verificationMethod\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"did:web:id.test-suite.app:finance:cfbac7a9-0e0c-4bd8-af71-05e33f9e47a5#key-01\",\n          \"type\": \"Multikey\",\n          \"controller\": \"did:web:id.test-suite.app:finance:cfbac7a9-0e0c-4bd8-af71-05e33f9e47a5\",\n          \"publicKeyMultibase\": \"z6Mkv4ZvmGpzfkxH9xvNq5mA3zwZoHuBisiQUyfCgXCfHeh4\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"authentication\": [\n        \"did:web:id.test-suite.app:finance:cfbac7a9-0e0c-4bd8-af71-05e33f9e47a5#key-01\"\n      ],\n      \"assertionMethod\": [\n        \"did:web:id.test-suite.app:finance:cfbac7a9-0e0c-4bd8-af71-05e33f9e47a5#key-01\"\n      ],\n      \"proof\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"DataIntegrityProof\",\n          \"proofPurpose\": \"assertionMethod\",\n          \"verificationMethod\": \"did:key:z6MkkiMtuEqx8NJcJTTWANmwfpAxZM54jy9Sv867xCN63tpT#z6MkkiMtuEqx8NJcJTTWANmwfpAxZM54jy9Sv867xCN63tpT\",\n          \"cryptosuite\": \"eddsa-jcs-2022\",\n          \"expires\": \"2025-02-20T22:43:40+00:00\",\n          \"domain\": \"id.test-suite.app\",\n          \"challenge\": \"6c0bbc23-be56-5f35-b873-3313c33b319b\",\n          \"proofValue\": \"z9T5HpCDZVZ1c3LgM5ctrYPm2erJR8Ww9o369577beiHc4Dz49See8t78VioPDt76AbRP7r2DnesezY4dBxYTVQ7\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre> Gets a list of pending did docs that need to be attested. </p> <p>Witness - Attest a did doc - <code>POST /did/webvh/attest?id=did:web:id.test-suite.app:finance:cfbac7a9-0e0c-4bd8-af71-05e33f9e47a5</code> <pre><code>{\n  \"status\": \"success\",\n  \"message\": \"Witness successful.\"\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>Controller - The controller gets a message <code>Received witness response: attested</code> and will finish creating the did.
